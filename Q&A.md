Because you do not know every possible future use for the data TerramEarth collects, you have decided to build a system that captures and stores all raw data in case you need it later. How can you most cost-effectively accomplish this goal?
A. Have the vehicles in the field stream the data directly into BigQuery.
B. Have the vehicles in the field pass the data to Cloud Pub/Sub and dump it into a Cloud Dataproc cluster that stores data in Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on persistent disks.
C. Have the vehicles in the field continue to dump data via FTP, adjust the existing Linux machines, and use a collector to upload them into Cloud Dataproc HDFS for storage.
D. Have the vehicles in the field continue to dump data via FTP, and adjust the existing Linux machines to immediately upload it to Cloud Storage with gsuti

Today, TerramEarth maintenance workers receive interactive performance graphs for the last 24 hours (86,400 events) by plugging their maintenance tablets into the vehicle. The support group wants support technicians to view this data remotely to help troubleshoot problems. You want to minimize the latency of graph loads. How should you provide this functionality?
A. Execute queries against data stored in a Cloud SQL.
B. Execute queries against data indexed by vehicle_id.timestamp in Cloud Bigtable.
C. Execute queries against data stored on daily partitioned BigQuery tables.
D. Execute queries against BigQuery with data stored in Cloud Storage via BigQuery federation.

Appilication parts developed by separate project teams will communicate over RFC1918 addresses 
A. Single project, same VPC
**B. Shared VPC, each project service of the Shared VPC project - VALID**
C. Parts communicate using HTTPS
D. Communicate over global load balancers, one per project 

Which solution should Dress4Win's real time trend analysis use in the cloud? 
A. Cloud DataFlow
B. BigQuery
C. A Hadoop cluster in Compute Engine
**D. Cloud DataProc - VALID **

Which network feature could help a company meet its goals to expand service to Asia while reducing latency
A. HTTP/TCP Load Balancer
B. Network TCP/UPD
C. Cloud Router
**D. Cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) - VALID**

How can you minimize the cost of storing security video files that are processed repeatedly for 30 days?
**A. Regional class, then move to Coldline after 30 days - VALID**
B. Nearline class, then move to Coldline after 30 days 
C. Regional class, then move to Nearline after 30 days
D. Multi-regional class, then move to Coldline after 30 days
